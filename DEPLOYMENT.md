## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices
- âœ… API keys are in `.env` file (not committed)
- âœ… `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- âœ… Git history cleaned of secrets
- âœ… Environment variables used in deployment

## ðŸ§ª Test After Deployment
Test with this scenario:
> "I'm a project manager overseeing a cross-functional team. One of the key stakeholders, Karen from the finance department, is blocking our proposal to increase marketing spend..."

The AI should identify this as "The Desperate Seeker" and provide tactical advice.
