## Framework Overview

**Title:** Enhanced Relationship Management Framework  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Description:** Comprehensive framework for analyzing and managing relationships with position templates, scenarios, and tactical guidance

This enhanced framework builds upon the original relationship management concepts by adding:
- **Twelve Position Templates:** Detailed guidance for each relationship type based on Desire, Power, and Rapport combinations
- **Real-World Scenarios:** Practical examples with analysis and tactics
- **Decision Trees:** Step-by-step guidance for complex decisions
- **Tactical Templates:** Structured approaches for different engagement types

---

## Core Concepts

### 1.1 What is a Relationship?
A relationship is a running series of engagements between two parties. Even if no engagements have occurred, as long as you are aware of the other party, a relationship can be calculated. An engagement is defined as a direct interaction between two parties where some form of communication is exchanged.

**Engagement Types:** offensive, defensive, competitive, null

### 1.2 Components of a Relationship
The three components of a relationship are **Desire**, **Power**, and **Rapport**.

- **Desire:** The amount one party wishes to engage with the other, based on the party's goal
  - High Desire: One party wants something from the other
  - Low Desire: One party wants nothing from the other

### 1.2.1 Relative Power
Relative Power is the capacity of one party to exert its will on the other, based on **Respect**, **Harm**, and **Aid**.

- **Respect:** Power from having high standing in the other party's eyes
- **Harm:** Power to negatively affect the other party's goals or resources
- **Aid:** Power to positively affect the other party's goals or resources

Overall Relative Power is zero-sum - high power in one area is nullified by low power in another.

### 1.2.2 Rapport
Rapport is the ease with which one party can engage the other based on their history of engagements.

- **High Rapport:** Many positive engagements
- **Low Rapport:** Many negative engagements

### 1.3 Types of Relationships
From the analyzer's perspective, there are **twelve types of relationships** based on the combination of Desire (High/Low), Power (High/Even/Low), and Rapport (High/Low):

**High Desire Relationships:**
1. **Dominant** (High Desire-High Power-High Rapport)
2. **Subjugative** (High Desire-High Power-Low Rapport)
3. **Collaborative** (High Desire-Even Power-High Rapport)
4. **Compromising** (High Desire-Even Power-Low Rapport)
5. **Appealing** (High Desire-Low Power-High Rapport)
6. **Supplicating** (High Desire-Low Power-Low Rapport)

**Low Desire Relationships:**
7. **Protective** (Low Desire-High Power-High Rapport)
8. **Dismissive** (Low Desire-High Power-Low Rapport)
9. **Resistant** (Low Desire-Even Power-High Rapport)
10. **Avoidant** (Low Desire-Even Power-Low Rapport)
11. **Defensive** (Low Desire-Low Power-High Rapport)
12. **Accommodating** (Low Desire-Low Power-Low Rapport)

## Analysis Framework

### 2.1 What is Analyzing for Engagement?
Analyzing for engagement means gaining an understanding of the other party's position so that you can optimize your position before engaging. This involves analyzing:
- Engagement Desire
- Relative Power
- Rapport
- Character Vulnerabilities

### 2.2 Engagement Desire Analysis
Engagement Desire is assessing the mental decision one comes to about a prospective request based on the request's effect on their goals and resources. This differs from overall Relationship desire - one could have high relationship desire but low engagement desire for a specific unfavorable request.

**Components:** Value, Resources

### 2.2.1 Components of Desire
The components of desire are:
- **Value:** How a request affects their relevant goal
- **Resources:** What one has to accomplish their goal with

**Goal Types:** acquire, maintain, dispose  
**Resource Types:** tangible (money), intangible (time)

### 2.2.2 Engagement Desire Matrix
The Engagement Desire Matrix uses scores from 3 (high) to -1 (negative) for both Value and Cost. Cost is subtracted from Value to give the Desire level between 4 (Desperate for) and -4 (Desperate to avoid).

**Value Scores:**
- 3: High (will satisfy goal)
- 2: Medium (will reasonably further goal)
- 1: Low (will slightly further goal)
- 0: None (will not further goal)
- -1: Negative (will detract from goal)

### 2.3 Relative Power Analysis
Relative Power Analysis examines three components:
- **Respect:** Power from having high standing
- **Harm:** Power to negatively affect the other party's goals or resources
- **Aid:** Power to positively affect the other party's goals or resources

Each can be High, Even, or Low relative to the other party.

### 2.4 Rapport Analysis
Rapport Analysis examines three components:
- **Number of engagements:** How many times you've directly communicated
- **Nature of engagements:** Positive, neutral, or negative
- **Comfort level of engagements:** Shallow, moderate, or deep

Deep engagements involve personal and private communications about identity and mission.

### 2.5 Character Vulnerability Analysis
Character Vulnerability Analysis identifies traits of the other party that allow you to alter their perception of Value and Cost.

**Types:**
- **Intellectual vulnerabilities:** dim, naive, uninformed
- **Emotional vulnerabilities:** empathetic, insecurity, egotistic

These can be exploited during engagement.

---

## Preparation Framework

### 3.1 Improve Your Assessed Position
Long-term adjustments to improve your position include increasing Relative Power through Respect, Harm, and Aid.

**For low or even power:**
- Build rapport to increase your importance
- Gain means to harm/benefit them
- Neutralize their means

**For high power:**
- Maintain your sources
- Resist their attempts

### 3.2 Ready Engagement Tactics
Engagement Tactics are techniques used during engagement to adjust the other party's desire.

**Tactic Types:**
- **Exploitation:** Using character flaws
- **Persuasion:** Constructing arguments to change perception
- **Manipulation:** Provoking fear of your power

Each can be used offensively or defensively.

### 3.2.1 Exploitation
Exploitation uses the other party's character flaws to change their desire level.

**Intellectual Exploitation:**
- **Dim people:** Complicate arguments
- **Naive people:** Introduce unknown negative consequences
- **Uninformed people:** Make claims they can't refute

**Emotional Exploitation:**
- **Empathetic people:** Make them feel bad
- **Insecure people:** Suggest inadequacy
- **Egotistic people:** Suggest your position glorifies them

### 3.2.2 Persuasion
Persuasion constructs arguments to change how the other party perceives the effect to their goals and resources.

**Types:**
- **True Offensive Persuasion:** Talks them into seeing your request as more beneficial and requiring fewer resources
- **True Defensive Persuasion:** Talks them into seeing their request as less helpful and more costly
- **False persuasion (begging/pleading):** Only available when certain character flaws are present and immediately gives them power over you

### 3.2.3 Manipulation
Manipulation constructs arguments to alter desire by provoking fear of your power.

**Types:**
- **Offensive Manipulation:** Uses fear to make your request more desirable
- **Defensive Manipulation:** Uses fear to make their request less desirable

**Power Sources:**
- **Rapport:** Losing standing
- **Harm:** Hurting their goals
- **Aid:** Not furthering their goals

Aid power threatens to take away existing help rather than offering quid pro quo.
