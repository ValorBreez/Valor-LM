# Valor LM Project Summary

## Project Overview
Valor LM is an AI-powered professional relationship strategist based on a comprehensive Valor relationship management framework. The system provides strategic advice for navigating complex professional relationships by analyzing power dynamics, rapport levels, and desired outcomes.

## Core Framework
The project is built around a sophisticated relationship framework that categorizes relationships into 12 distinct types based on three key dimensions:

### Dimensions
- **Desire**: High/Low - How much you want something from the relationship
- **Power**: High/Even/Low - Relative power dynamics between parties
- **Rapport**: High/Low - Level of trust and connection

### Relationship Types
Each combination creates specific relationship archetypes with tailored characteristics, tactical priorities, and warning signs:

1. **High Desire + High Power + High Rapport** - "The Leveraged Ally"
2. **High Desire + High Power + Low Rapport** - "The Reluctant Resource"
3. **High Desire + Even Power + High Rapport** - "The Collaborative Partner"
4. **High Desire + Even Power + Low Rapport** - "The Stalemate"
5. **High Desire + Low Power + High Rapport** - "The Benevolent Patron"
6. **High Desire + Low Power + Low Rapport** - "The Desperate Seeker"
7. **Low Desire + High Power + High Rapport** - "The Valued Mentor"
8. **Low Desire + High Power + Low Rapport** - "The Unwanted Authority"
9. **Low Desire + Even Power + High Rapport** - "The Trusted Peer"
10. **Low Desire + Even Power + Low Rapport** - "The Neutral Acquaintance"
11. **Low Desire + Low Power + High Rapport** - "The Supportive Friend"
12. **Low Desire + Low Power + Low Rapport** - "The Distant Contact"

## AI Response Framework
The AI assistant has been refined to provide:
- **Framework-driven advice** rather than generic responses
- **Concise responses** (100 words max) to avoid token limits
- **Question-first approach** - asks clarifying questions before giving advice
- **Specific tactical suggestions** including exploitation, persuasion, manipulation, and power building strategies
- **Positional improvement recommendations** rather than generic advice

## Technical Implementation
The system uses:
- **OpenAI function calling** for structured output
- **Multi-step processing** for complex scenarios
- **Rich context framework** stored in JSON format
- **System prompts** that enforce framework-driven responses

## Business Strategy
The project is positioned as a B2B-focused AI assistant targeting:
- **Primary users**: Managers and teams
- **Integration points**: In-flow-of-work tools (chatbots, CRM plugins)

### Target Markets
1. **Sales teams** - Relationship management with prospects and clients
2. **HR professionals** - Employee relations and conflict resolution
3. **Project managers** - Stakeholder management
4. **Executives** - Strategic relationship building
